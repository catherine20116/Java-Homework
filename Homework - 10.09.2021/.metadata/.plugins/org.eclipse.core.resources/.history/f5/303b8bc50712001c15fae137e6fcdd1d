/*
 Create a Java console application that:
 produces an array of numbers (grades) that is created for storing grades.
 The size of the array is randomly selected between 10(incl) and 50 (incl).
 The array grades are populated with random numbers between 1 and 10.
 The contents of the array are output to the console without using the Arrays.toString method.
 The average value of the elements of the array grades is calculated and displayed on the screen.
 An additional challenge: to store decimals (float) in an array.
